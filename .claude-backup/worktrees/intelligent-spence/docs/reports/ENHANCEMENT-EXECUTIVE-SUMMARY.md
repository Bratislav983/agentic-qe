## 🎨 Webapp Feature Set (MVP)

### Core Features
1. **Agent Fleet View** (18 QE + 54 CF agents)
   - Real-time status cards
   - Color-coded states (idle/active/busy/error)
   - Click to expand details

2. **Test Execution Dashboard**
   - Live progress bars per suite
   - Pass/fail/skip counters
   - Coverage gauges (statements/branches/functions/lines)

3. **Activity Console**
   - Scrollable log with filtering
   - Color-coded by level (system/success/warning/error/info)
   - Agent name badges

4. **Quality Metrics**
   - Quality gate status (pass/fail)
   - Threshold gauges
   - Trend charts (last 30 days)

### Technology Stack
```typescript
{
  frontend: "React 18 + TypeScript + Vite",
  state: "Zustand",
  ui: "shadcn/ui + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS",
  charts: "Recharts",
  realtime: "SSE + WebSocket (socket.io)",
  backend: "Express + TypeScript (extend MCP)",
  deployment: "Local bundled server (localhost:3000)"
}
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Vector Quantization
- ✅ Memory: 30MB → 7.5MB (4x reduction)
- ✅ Speed: 1ms → 0.3ms (3x faster)
- ✅ Accuracy: >98% maintained
- ✅ Cost: -$50-200/month

### Webapp MVP
- ✅ User Adoption: 30% try in month 1
- ✅ Engagement: 20% weekly active users
- ✅ NPS Score: >40
- ✅ Time to Value: -60% (30 min → 10 min)
- ✅ Support Tickets: -30%

## 🔥 Why This Matters

### Current Position
- ✅ **Strong Foundation**: ReasoningBank integrated, AgentDB production-ready
- ✅ **Performance**: 150x faster vector search, <1ms latency
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: 70-81% savings from Multi-Model Router
- ❌ **Missing**: Visual dashboard, webapp UI

### Competitive Landscape
- **CLI-only tools**: Limited to power users
- **With webapp**: Accessible to QA managers, product owners, stakeholders
- **Market gap**: No QE fleet has integrated visual dashboard

### Strategic Impact
```
AQE Fleet v1.2.0 (Current):
└── Powerful CLI tool for power users

AQE Fleet v1.3.0 (Proposed):
└── Full-stack QE platform
    ├── Powerful CLI (existing)
    ├── Visual dashboard (new)
    ├── Real-time coordination (new)
    └── Interactive controls (new)
```

**Result**: First mover advantage in visual QE orchestration

## 🛠️ Implementation Risks

### Low Risk
- ✅ Vector Quantization (battle-tested in AgentDB)
- ✅ HNSW Optimization (proven at scale)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ Webapp Performance (WebSocket scalability)
- ⚠️ Browser Compatibility (older browsers)
- ⚠️ User Adoption (may prefer CLI)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Connection pooling, SSE fallback, Redis Pub/Sub
2. **Compatibility**: Babel transpilation, polyfills, graceful degradation
3. **Adoption**: User research, beta testing, maintain CLI parity
